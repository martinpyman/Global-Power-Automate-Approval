# Global-Power-Automate-Approval

As you won't have access to my Tenant, you will need to open the Zip file and modify the contents of the 
\Microsoft.Flow\flows\c80972e3-8c7a-4054-8ac6-24d3d2a62974\definition.json file

Update the following to your tenant URL:
"dataset":"https://marnotechnologycom.sharepoint.com"

Update the following with a Document Library ID where you would like the Automate to run from for Debugging:
"table":"d12426b5-5c97-4ee8-8dd6-71fdd6537904"

You should then be able to import this file into your tenant.
